# Responsiveness-Portfolio

For this exercise, I created a Portfolio to house my future projects. I used Bootstrap to style my HTML and ensure my pages were responsive to different screen sizes. To make sure the pages were responsive on screens ranging from computer to mobile, I was sure to apply Bootstrap's grid layout where necessary. 

The result should be fluid across devices and pages. Some features, like the navigation and footer, remain the same across each page even though the content changes. The content on each page should look as similar as possible regardless of device while still being easy to read and navigate.
